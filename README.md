🧬 Time Table Scheduling using Genetic Algorithm

This project automates the **creation of a class timetable** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** approach. It optimizes scheduling by considering multiple constraints such as faculty availability, subject load, class timings, and room allocation. The goal is to generate an efficient, conflict-free timetable automatically.

🚀 Features

* Automated timetable generation using **Genetic Algorithm**
* Conflict-free allocation of teachers, subjects, and rooms
* Scalable design for multiple departments and sections
* Adjustable parameters like population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate
* Simple Python-based interface (`app.py`)


🧩 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Genetic Algorithm (GA) principles**
* **Flask / Streamlit** (if `app.py` includes a web interface)
* **Libraries**: Listed in `requirements.txt`

⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   cd Time-table-genetic

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python app.py

4. Access the app in your browser (if it uses Flask/Streamlit).

📈 Advantages of Using It
* Saves manual effort and time in timetable creation
* Ensures optimized use of faculty and classrooms
* Reduces human errors and scheduling conflicts
* Easily configurable for different courses or institutions
* Can be extended with GUI or web dashboard for better visualization

🔮 Future Enhancements
* Integration with a database (MySQL / MongoDB)
* Adding user roles (Admin, Faculty, Student)
* Export timetable as PDF/Excel
* Real-time update and conflict reporting
* Web dashboard with analytics on resource utilization
